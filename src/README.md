# KOKORO
<br>
This is a restaurant website using only web technologies HTML5, CSS3 with no other modern web framework or library. Just a little Javascript added using Googlemap API to display a map. <br>Just a small disadvantaged note that this website is not developed as responsive as needed :( <br>
Demo can be found at : <a href="http://myy.haaga-helia.fi/~a1603173/KOKORO/src/" targer="_blank">Demo Website</a>
<br>
This is my personal project in the course Orientation to digital services at Haaga-Helia UAS
